recup_dir.1/
./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 109923528 200
report.xml showed file length was same as block byte run length

recup_dir.2/
initially ran ./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 110034675 1764
report.xml showed block bytes run less than file length. insufficient for
file.  
so i increased
file length by running
./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 110034675 1776
 this time we have 7274464 for image length and 7274496 for block byte runs.
 the command zcat xxx | tar tf- showd file contents.

recup_dir.3/
initially ran  ./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 110137082 471
 report.xml shows file length 1929184 and block byte runs 1966080.
 this should be ok
the command zcat xxx | tar tf- showd file contents.  (two txt files only)

recup_dir.4/
initially ran ./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 110370599 824.5 but this produces some kinda problem
so tryling next integer up
./harvest.sh /media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img 110370599 825
 report.xml shows file length 3379168, block byte run 3407872 (just larger.)
 we still have problem with zcat.  will try  larger:  834
