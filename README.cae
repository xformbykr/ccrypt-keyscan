readme file from cae on 5/25/22

attempting to add another capability within source code, to assist
in 'forensic' search for cpt encrypted file within a huge disk image.

idea is to run through stream until 'magic' c051 is found in decrypt
of a 32-byte block.  

will add command line directive, then stub code to be run, then
actual code to be run.  

hopefully will add check code, too.
