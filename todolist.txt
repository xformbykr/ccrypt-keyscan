1.  chaeck out the file boundaries per the filenames
and rec_dup.1 directory, vs. hexdump of 'img' file  (DONE; they are sectors)

2.  reproduce the shutoff problem using excised file.  then
work in 'ddd' to resolve it.

dd if=/media/cae/Seagate\ Expansion\ Drive/ToshRebuild/toshiba.full.img of=findNo1.short.cpt bs=32 skip=4258005459 count=32
../src/ccrypt -n -K buddhakarmamysticschmuck findNo1.short.cpt

I've changed line 402 of ccryptlib.c to break out of loop, not to return
out of loop. this removed 

3.  look at decrypted file; does it begin       1f 8b 08?  (NO) 

4.  change code to work through the whole image file, not
just stop at the first one! 'tee' the output and 2>&1 
  (i.e., stderr to stdout)

 see your notes in traverse.c and ccrypt.c.  don't carry stuff through 'r'.
 print out messages along the way.  

5.  test this with a composed file with multiple key-hits,
 using 'cat'. 

6.  double check with small files, all of your assumptions
  about what happens when IV is found.  that is, make a test
  file, using -n to locate IV, then use 'dd' to 'back-excise'
  the file, and check the result.
